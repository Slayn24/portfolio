Koala populations along the east coast of Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) are plummeting towards extinction and are on the country’s endangered species list. Populations in Victoria and South Australia, despite not being officially endangered, face shocking decline.  
                <br><br>
                The root cause in both cases is the same—habitat loss. But the symptoms are vastly different. In Queensland and NSW, koalas are scarcely seen because their habitat is so fragmented, driving down their numbers.  
                <br><br>
                Further south, numbers only tell half of the story. Particularly in Victoria’s southwest, koalas can easily be spotted. But many are starving and emaciated. Thousands of others are living in swathes of private blue gum plantations, where they’re at risk of death every single day. `

                Measuring only 1.2 to 1.5 metres (four to five feet) long and weighing just 27 to 68 kilograms (60 to 150 pounds) as adults, sun bears are the world’s smallest and most threatened bear species. The IUCN lists sun bears as vulnerable—just one step away from being endangered. Their habitat in the tropical forests of Southeast Asia is diminishing, they’re hunted for their body parts and fur, and they face the risk of being captured for the pet trade. `

                Backed by 20 years of science and engagement with local communities, Room to Roam is securing and connecting habitats, creating safe passages for wildlife to travel freely through their home ranges in East and southern Africa. The positive outcomes of this far-reaching initiative will be greater biodiversity, natural resilience to climate change, and a future where animals and people can coexist and thrive.

Today, an estimated total of 54 rhinos roam and thrive in the area and the population is steadily growing. Nearly 50% of this population is thanks to the work of IFAW and the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI). A leading factor in the incredible success of this project is the close partnership between IFAW and WTI—a partnership that’s been going strong for 20 years, a milestone we celebrated in 2021.

                “Consistency has made our partnership with the Wildlife Trust of India incredibly unique and has led to a tremendous impact for wildlife and communities in India,” said Meredith Whitney, an Animal Rescue Program Manager at IFAW. “Since this project first began in the early 2000s, we have maintained a consistent focus to restore rhino population in Manas National Park, rebuilding the population one rescued rhino at a time.  
                <br><br>
                Our partnership to bring rhinos back to Manas National Park is a powerful example of how IFAW and our partners create impact through a rich combination of community engagement, animal rehabilitation and habitat conservation.

The first task for Orphans of Fire was to help the pups gain weight, experience natural bonding and learn to survive on their own, all in the absence of their mothers, who the pups would normally depend on for their first 10 months of life. Next, Orphans of Fire would release the orphans back into the wild. If successful, this would be the first-known release of giant anteaters rehabilitated from such a young age.

                Luckily, the IFAW–Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) Centre for Bear Rehabilitation and Conservation (CBRC) is here to help. Across northeastern India, poaching of black bears is unfortunately a common occurrence. The cubs of poached mother bears often die alone, while others are captured for zoos or the exotic pet trade. As a result of these and other threats, Asiatic black bears are classed by the IUCN as a vulnerable species. The goal of CBRC is to rehabilitate these orphaned cubs and prepare them for a successful release back into the wild.

                Sadly, North Atlantic right whales face threats in the form of vessel strikes, entanglement in fishing gear, ocean noise pollution, and climate change. They can live up to 70 years, but increasing fishing and boating activities—not to mention the imminent threat climate change poses to ocean temperatures—shorten the lifespans of these magnificent marine mammals, who are some of the largest living animals on Earth.

                North Atlantic right whales are not reproducing fast enough to offset their deaths. Since NOAA declared an Unusual Mortality Event in 2017, there have been 41 documented right whale deaths, 37 serious injuries and 70 morbidities, which represents over 35% of the current North Atlantic right whale population. Further, research suggests that that only 1/3 of right whale deaths are documented, so the death toll is likely much higher. In comparison, there have only been 88 births in this same period—and at least nine of those calves died in the same season they were born.

IFAW has been the first line of defense for stranded marine mammals in distress for the past 20 years, rescuing and releasing them, whenever possible, back into the wild. As a result of its efforts and innovation, IFAW has created the most comprehensive cetacean stranding response program in the world, with 2019 marking the most active period of marine mammal rescue ever.

                The innovations of IFAW’s Marine Mammal Rescue team have revolutionized how stranded dolphins are evaluated and treated in the field. Now, nearly 80% of stranded dolphins are able to be released back into the wild. We’ve pioneered field health assessments and treatments, all rapidly performed within a matter of hours, to improve the likelihood of survival after release, challenging the long-standing paradigm that all single stranded dolphins are sick and must therefore be euthanized.

                desc: `Thanks to recent scientific research, we know that animals play a central role in capturing carbon and storing it in the ocean and landscapes where they live, making a significant contribution to climate change mitigation. But wild animals have far more to offer in the way of climate action, beyond their incredible potential to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Wildlife conservation is a powerful way to help some of the world’s most vulnerable communities and least developed countries adapt to climate change and build climate-resilient economies that can withstand its worst effects—here’s how. 
                <br><br>
                Around the world, many of the biodiverse landscapes where wild animals have the greatest potential to sequester carbon are also landscapes where people are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. From the rainforests and cerrado of Latin America to the Congo Basin, and from the savannahs of East and southern Africa to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, biodiversity hotspots are home to some of the poorest and most marginalised people in the world, including the Indigenous Peoples who are the customary stewards of much of the world’s land biodiversity.

                Indonesia is an epicenter for natural disasters like volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, earthquakes, and landslides. When these disasters strike, marginalized people and animals tend to be hit hardest and feel the impacts of the disaster longer. Remote communities are often left on their own to prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters, although they rarely have access to the resources and support to do so.
                <br><br><br>
                <b>Solution</b><br><br>
                Communities near Mt. Agung live at constant risk of natural disasters. To help mitigate this “new normal”, IFAW and BAWA initiated a pilot project focused on helping two remote communities on Mt. Agung build resilience and prepare for future disasters. By working directly with community members and local government, we are able to imbed disaster risk reduction into village level systems that ensure all members of the community are prepared long-term.
